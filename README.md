For the course Web Programming on Academy for Creative Industries I have made the home page of my former internship company; an indie record label in the Netherlands. 

Welcome to this READ ME file for home page website in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as of November 3rd 2019.

Language: English
Version: 1.0

You are looking at a school project made for the course Web Programming. For this project a homepage website has been programmed for a record company.  The coding languages HTML, CSS, JavaScript have been used. Therefor, there are separate files for HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This home page contains a navigation bar, two photo sliders, a footer and a news section.

The next version would include pages for the 6 subjects on the navigation bar, and fixed codes for the current bugs. The current bugs are: the JavaScript elements scroll over the navigation bar and the navigation bar doesnâ€™t crop when the screen size is adjusted. 

It is possible to open the code, look at the code, copy it or change it via a program such as Visual Studio Code. Latest version of Visual Studio Code available from https://code.visualstudio.com/download.

Please do NOT use this code as a foundation for your website, because it still contains unfixed and unknown bugs. This is the first programming project I have worked on and therefor I would recommend you to use other codes made by professional and more experienced coders.
